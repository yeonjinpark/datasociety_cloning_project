        <p>
            In 2017-2018, Data & Society worked to balance our commitment 
            to rigorous empirical research with new engagement efforts to 
            ensure that this knowledge reaches those shaping the development 
            and governance of technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            This year, we welcomed new Executive Director Janet Haven and 
            began our first strategic planning sprint to calibrate our efforts 
            so that our research insights continue to have both resonance and 
            reach.
        </p>
        <p>
            As Data & Society moves into its fifth year, 
            we will continue to pursue frame-breaking research questions 
            informed by the realities of those who may be adversely affected 
            by data-centric and automated technologies.

            "OUR STRATEGY COMMITS US TO RIGOROUS RESEARCH AND
            FIELD-EXPANDING ENGAGEMENT WORK THAT ASSERTS THE VALUES OF FAIRNESS, 
            ACCOUNTABILITY, AND JUSTICE IN A DATA-CENTRIC WORLD."

        <p>
            To challenge existing narratives about the purpose and power of 
            technology in society using <strong>rigorous interdisciplinary research</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            To expand and support a diverse field of people 
            and organizations grappling with cultural, legal, political, and technical approaches 
            to issues raised by data-centric technologies
        </p>
        <p>
            To ensure that civil society, media, policymakers, 
            and industry engage with our research insights—and those of 
            our broader network—to inform and reframe decision-making around technology
        </p>
        <p>
            To encourage a culture and practice of open experimentation 
            and new forms of knowledge production
